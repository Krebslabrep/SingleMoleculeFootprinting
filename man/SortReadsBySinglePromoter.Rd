\title{Wrapper to SortReads for Promoter case}
\usage{
SortReadsBySinglePromoter(MethSM, TSS, species = species, coverage = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{MethSM}{Single molecule matrix list as returned by CallContextMethylation}

\item{TSS}{Transcription Start Site to use for sorting, passed as a GRanges object of length >= 1}

\item{species}{species for promoter sorting (either "MM" for mouse or "DM" for Drosophila)}

\item{coverage}{integer. Minimum number of reads covering all sorting bins for sorting to be performed. Defaults to 30}
}
\value{
List of reads sorted by promoter
}
