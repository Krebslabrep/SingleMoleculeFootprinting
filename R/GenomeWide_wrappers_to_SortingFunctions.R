#' Convenience function to arrange a list of given TFBSs into clusters
#' 
#' For each TFBS, the genomic neighborhood defined by max_cluster_width will be scanned for adjacent TFBSs. 
#' The hits will be filtered for min_intersite_distance where, in case of overlapping TFBSs, the second TFBS will be arbitrarily dropped.
#' These TFBSs plus the central "anchoring" one will define a TFBS cluster. 
#' This approach implies that the same TFBS can be employed to design multiple clusters in a sliding-window fashion.

#'                               This parameter should be set according to the width of the bins used for later sorting. Defaults to 15.
